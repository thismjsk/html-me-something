        <h2>Poems About Pizza</h2>
        <h3>This is exactly what is sounds like.</h3>
        <p>A wise man once said, "Poetry is a lot like pizza. It's a canvas in which one works <em>true</em> art."</p>
    
        <div><!--this section will act the introduction-->
            <p>On a foggy November afternoon, a close friend of mine thought aloud, <i>"I have yet to be awestruck by the celebration of pizza conveyed through poetry.</i> I nodded, and thought...could <em>I</em> embrace this challenge and convey pizza's majesty?</p>
            <p>I shall do my best.</p>

                <h4>Pepperoni &#38; Sausage</h4>
                <p>There's the first slice<br>
                lifted from the steam<br>
                the cheese ascending<br>
                pulled taught and stretched<br>
                until the snap of mozzarella<br>
                releases the marvel<br>
                to fulfill its destiny<br>
                marrying beef with pork<br>
                to throw a party in my belly.</p>

                <h4>The Delivery</h4>
                <p>I've waited<br>
                and waited<br>
                waited for you.<br>
                <br>
                I'll keep waiting<br>
                and waiting<br>
                waiting for you.<br>
                <br>
                I'm still waiting<br>
                just waiting<br>
                I'll wait forever, for you.<br>
                <br>
                Someday you'll come<br>
                to help me believe, again<br>
                I believe you'll come.<br>
                <br>
                Will you come<br>
                before my last breath<br>
                escapes my skull?<br>
                <br>
                Should you come<br>
                after I'm gone<br>
                I'll wait for you.<br>
                <br>
                I'll wait and wait<br>
                and wait<br>
                and wait...<br>
