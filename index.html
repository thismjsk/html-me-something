        <h2>Poems About Pizza</h2>
        <h3>This is exactly what is sounds like.</h3>
        <p>A wise man once said, "Poetry is a lot like pizza. It's a canvas in which one works <em>true</em> art."</p>
    
        <div><!--this section will act the introduction-->
            <p>On a foggy November afternoon, a close friend of mine thought aloud, <i>"I have yet to be awestruck by the celebration of pizza conveyed through poetry.</i> I nodded, and thought...could <em>I</em> embrace this challenge and convey pizza's majesty?</p>
            <p>I shall do my best.</p>
